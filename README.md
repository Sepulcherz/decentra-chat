Hello there! 

You might be wondering what the actual fouek is that?

Well, let's just say it's a test repo that goes hand in hand with : "https://github.com/Sepulcherz/Web3-Bounty-Hunting-MockRepo", the errors and missing code is intentionnal, so I suggest you go to the previously mentioned repo first, but do what you want anyway!

It's a simple wasm/rust page that connects to sepolia testnet with your metamask wallet, where you can try to post and like something, some sort of decentralized social media if you will, which only purpose is to test the aforementionned repo.

I'm new to web3 and wanted to try some stuff.

Have fun!
